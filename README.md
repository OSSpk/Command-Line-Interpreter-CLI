A Command Line Interpreter made in C++ which supports commands like quit, remove, rename, rmdir, echo, out, zip, unzip.

## Problem Statement

Making our own Command Line Interpreter
In this problem you have to develop a small-scale command line interpreter. Your CLI should support the following commands:

1. **quit**: Exit your CLI

2. **remove file_name**:  removes the given file name. (Hint: Use remove C/C++‚Äôs built-in function  remove() ).

3. **rename old_name new_name**: rename the given file/folder. (Hint: Use C/C++‚Äôs built-in function rename() ).

4. **rmdir directory_name**: remove directory.  Assume that the directory is always empty. You do not have to handle the deletion of a directory that is not empty.

5. **echo ‚Äúdata‚Äù optional_file_name**: Whatever data is given in the quotation marks is written to the given file. If the file name is not given, the data in string is simply printed on the screen.

6. **out -l file_name_1 file_name2 file_name_3**: The contents of given files are printed one by one on the screen. When the contents of one file are printed, user is asked to press some key to continue. User must enter at least 1 file name. (If the user has specified -l, then the file contents are printed line by line, and the user is asked to press some key to continue after each line.)

7. **zip destination file_name**: zips the given file/folder. (Hint: Use system() function. system(‚Äútar cvf ‚Äú+ destination+‚Äù  ‚Äú+ file_name) ).

8. **unzip file_name**: unzips the given  zipped file. Use system() in this case, too.

You can only use system() in zip/unzip command. You must not use it for any other command.

## How to Run

Download the Code folder and using Ubuntu Bash or Windows or Linux Terminal, change current working directory to the Code folder.
Then on the terminal, type

```
./cli.out
```
